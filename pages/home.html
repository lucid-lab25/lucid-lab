    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      Lucid Lab, led by Professor Khandakar Ashrafi Akbar, explores how
      artificial general intelligence (AGI), machine learning, and generative AI
      can transform security and privacy. Our research develops usable,
      scalable, and sustainable defenses—from automated patch recommendation
      systems to system-level protections—guided by the vision of “Accessible by
      All Security.” We focus on bridging cutting-edge AI with real-world
      impact, ensuring that intelligent technologies remain secure, inclusive,
      and environmentally responsible.
