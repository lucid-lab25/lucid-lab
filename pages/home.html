    <h1>Welcome to LUCID Lab</h1>
    <p>
      LUCID (Learning and Usability for Cybersecurity and Intelligent Decisions) Lab, led by Dr. Khandakar Ashrafi
      Akbar, explores how AI and generative technologies can transform security, privacy, and decision-making. Guided by the
      vision of “Accessible by All Security”, we design defenses that are usable, scalable, and impactful for real-world
      adoption.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Our work spans human-centered and usable security, exploring the risks and opportunities in generative AI, building
      context-aware intelligent systems, designing transparent and resilient evaluation metrics, and advancing the
      performance analysis of next-generation AI models.
