    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      LUCID Lab (Learning and Usability for Cybersecurity and Intelligent Decisions), led by Dr. Khandakar Ashrafi
      Akbar,
      investigates how artificial general intelligence (AGI), machine learning, and generative AI can transform the
      landscape
      of security, privacy, and intelligent decision-making. Guided by the vision of “Accessible by All Security”, our
      mission
      is to design defenses that are not only usable, scalable, and sustainable, but also meaningful for real-world
      adoption.

      Our research spans a diverse set of areas, including:
      <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
        <li> Human-Centered and Usable Security – ensuring systems are secure while remaining intuitive and inclusive for all
          users.
        </li>
        <li>
          Exploration of Nuanced Factors in Generative AI Systems – uncovering hidden biases, risks, and opportunities
          within advanced AI models.
        </li>
        <li>
          Development of Context-Aware Intelligent Systems – building adaptive technologies that make secure, informed
          decisions in dynamic environments.
        </li>
        <li>
          Design of Resilient and Interpretable Evaluation Metrics – creating transparent methods to measure the
          robustness and fairness of intelligent systems.
        </li>
        <li>
          Performance Evaluation and Analysis of Generative AI Models – advancing rigorous frameworks for testing and
          optimizing next-generation AI.
        </li>
      </ul>
